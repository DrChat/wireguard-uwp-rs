# WireGuard UWP

A Universal Windows Platform (UWP) [VPN Plug-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.networking.vpn.ivpnplugin) for [WireGuard<sup>Â®</sup>](https://www.wireguard.com/) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Windows provides a plug-in based model for adding 3rd-party VPN protocols. VPN profiles
backed by such a plugin are referred to as **Plugin**/**3rd-party**/**UWP** profiles, as opposed
to **Native** profiles (i.e. built-in SSTP, IKEv2).

**WireGuard** is a VPN protocol that aims to be: Fast, Modern and Secure. Principles
which dovetail quite nicely with the Rust programming language. The actual noise-based WireGuard
implementation comes from Cloudflare's [boringtun](https://github.com/cloudflare/boringtun).

With the rapidly maturing [Rust for Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs) bindings,
this projects serve as a fun experiment in putting all the above together.

## Building

Make sure you have Rust installed. Then, once you've cloned the repo just simply run:
```console
$ cargo build --release
```

The project currently only builds on Windows but given the Windows-specific nature, that's not
considered a limitation.

## Installing

Once you've successfully built the project, you can install it by running the following commands
in a powershell prompt from the repo root:
```powershell
copy appx\* target\release
Add-AppxPackage -Register .\target\release\AppxManifest.xml
```

**NOTE:** This does an in-place sort of installation in that the installed app will refer to
the binaries in your `target\release` folder. So you may encounter issues if you modify those
after installation. This is just a stop-gap until a proper `.appx` can be generated.

## Running

To get your VPN tunnel up and running:

1. Open Windows Settings and navigate to the VPN page:
`Network & Internet > VPN`.
2. Select `Add a VPN connection.
3. From the `VPN provider` dropdown select **WireGuard UWP VPN**.
4. Give your new VPN profile a name under `Connection name`.
5. Enter the remote endpoint hostname or IP address under `Server name or address`.
6. Hit `Save`.

The settings you can tweak from the Windows Settings UI are limited to just the profile name
and remote endpoint's hostname. To modify the private key, public key, remote port etc we must
set those values manually. From a powershell prompt:

```powershell
$vpnConfig = @'
<WireGuard>
    <Interface>
        <PrivateKey>...</PrivateKey>
        <Address>10.0.0.2/32</Address>
    </Interface>
    <Peer>
        <PublicKey>...</PublicKey>
        <Port>51000</Port>
        <AllowedIPs>10.0.0.0/24</AllowedIPs>
        <AllowedIPs>10.10.0.0/24</AllowedIPs>
        <AllowedIPs>10.20.0.0/24</AllowedIPs>
        <PersistentKeepalive>25</PersistentKeepalive>
    </Peer>
</WireGuard>
'@

Set-VpnConnection -Name ProfileNameHere -CustomConfiguration $vpnConfig
```

The only required values are `PrivateKey`, `Address`, `PublicKey`, & `Port`. The rest are optional.
You may repeat `Address` multiple times to assign multiple IPv4 & IPv6 addresses to the virtual
interface. Similarly, you may specify `AllowedIPs` multiple times to define the routes that
should go over the virtual interface.

You should now be able to select the new profile and hit `Connect`.

**NOTE:** Ideally, you could just specify `Port` colon separated with the hostname but the
corresponding API for retrieving that value is statically typed as a HostName.

**NOTE:** The main foreground app is planned to offer a simple UI for setting and modifying these
values.

This has only been tested on Windows 10 21H1 (19043.1348) but should work on any updated
Windows 10 or 11 release. It'll probably work on older versions but no guarantees.

## Tracing

The plugin emits a number of [ETW](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/event-tracing-portal)
under the Event Provider identified by a specific GUID (`c4522a55-401f-4b81-93f9-aa0d1db734c4`). The events
are emitted with the help of the [rust_win_etw](https://github.com/microsoft/rust_win_etw) crate which
provides a way to define & emit ETW events from your Rust code.

To consume these events, there are a number of different tools which can be used. **rust_win_etw** provides
a quick rundown on how to capture them: https://github.com/microsoft/rust_win_etw#how-to-capture-and-view-events
